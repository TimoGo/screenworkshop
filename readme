Goal: a simple screen multiuser environment
- guest users login with ssh and public key - the ssh session is starting immediately
- guest users dont get a shell - instead the forced command= ssh option is used 
  to start "screen" with the appropriate options
- but be carefull: only invite trustful users - they could takeover the screen-session!

1) use ./build.sh to build image
2) configure network-settings in start.sh (vi start.sh)
3) use ./start.sh to start container
4) login with ssh as screen user (ssh -l screen IP) - password: changeme
5) add an account with: sudo add-screen-user.sh
5a) enter login name of new user
5b) enter public key of new user
6) as appropriate create several accounts with step 5)
7) start screen: screen -d -m -S shared && screen -r share
8) invite the guests to login via ssh: ssh -l guestname $IP
   
9) use destroy.sh to 
9a) kill container
9b) delete container
9c) delete image


Known problems
- the session gets killed if a guest quits with exit
